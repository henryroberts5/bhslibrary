		<p>Mrs. Wade</p>
		<p>I am so excited to "B" here! My name is Frankie Wade. My undergraduate degree is a Bachelor of Science in Education with a minor in English, and my Master's is also in Education with an endorsement in Library Science. This is my second year at Bartlett High, and I love my job! I'm so thrilled to have the opportunity to work with high school students and teachers. Plus, I have the added pleasure of working with a great co-librarian, Mrs. Sherry Simmons.</p>
